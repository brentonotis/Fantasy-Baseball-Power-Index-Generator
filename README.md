# Fantasy Baseball Power Index Generator

Intending to create algorithim that takes data object, sorts through arrays and ranks each item/re-assigns numeric value for each item based on rank (i.e.: most hits = 1, second most = 2), then takes average of all category rank values per element and sorts based overall avg. rank (i.e.:numeric rank for 'B', hits = 1, rbis = 2, bavg = 1; avg. rank value = 1.3 - then sorts based on final avg. rank value of each element).

This is essentially (totally) a fantasy baseball league I'm trying to generate a 'power ranking' index of sorts for. Full data set will be 12 teams w/ 14 categories each. What's here is progress but not succesfull as intended. Researching different approach.
