# Fantasy Baseball Power Index Generator

This is essentially (totally) a fantasy baseball league I'm trying to generate a 'power ranking' index of sorts for. Full data set will be 12 teams w/ 14 categories each. This is for the sole purpose of offering up the fantasy argument of "well, I may be in last place, but my avg. category ranking (power ranking) would actually have me in 10th... I'm just un-lucky this year..."

User-stories: 12 teams each provide 14 categories of data. Take data sets, rank each team by category, return avg. ranking per team per all categories, print 'power ranking' listing each team's avg. cateogry ranking from least (best) to most (worst).

Update 06/21 ** Finally fully functional (via Python)! Going to try and convert to JavaScript in the future for front-end app. Adding full data-set to test, but functionality should all be there.
